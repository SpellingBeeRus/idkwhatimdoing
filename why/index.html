			<div class="paragraph slim">Hey, glad you're here! I'm Haka, the main developer behind A.C.A.S. I know my software isn't for everyone, and to be honest, I'm probably writing this for myself too, since I don't always feel completely at ease with it. But I do believe A.C.A.S has potential to be used for good, which is why I try to guide its development in that direction.</div>

			<div class="paragraph slim">When I was younger, I was fascinated by cheat GUIs - they felt like this almost sacred control panel, with each setting holding so much power beneath it. I wanted to make one myself, focusing on crafting the UI. Most GUIs were basic, ugly even, and lacked any real attention to how they looked or felt. I've always had this drive to make things look nice, to polish them and make them stand out.</div>

			<div class="paragraph slim">Making a "cheat" (assistance software) like this is less about breaking rules and more about pushing boundaries and allowing me to, perhaps selfishly, make my long awaited GUI. It's a way to spark curiosity and motivate myself to learn more about things that otherwise wouldn't interest me.</div>

			<div class="paragraph slim">Now don't get me wrong, <i>almost</i> all things web dev are amazing, but sometimes we just lack the motivation to even start, you know... I know many people who started programming and then just couldn't figure out interesting projects to make, then they gave up and did not progress.</div>

			<div class="paragraph slim">I get the ethical concerns around cheats, and I've always tried to use them responsibly. If I keep working on this project, I want to make it more about learning. The goal is to give users feedback on their moves, so they can improve and actually understand the process, not just follow instructions. It's about helping them grow and get better over time. This would've happened sooner, but I lack experience in chess engine development, so I still have a ways to go before I can add those features.</div>

			<div class="paragraph slim">A.C.A.S is currently "marketed" as a cheat because that's what grabs people's attention and helps it spread without me having to push it too hard. I've barely done any actual marketing for the software - it just got noticed on GreasyFork because there wasn't much competition. You can rest assured, though, I'm not a fan of cheating and don't condone it in any way.</div>

			<div class="paragraph slim">At the end of the day, please remember there's a difference between making a "cheat" and actually cheating, which is against A.C.A.S' terms of service by the way.</div>
